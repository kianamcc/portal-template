## Using Synapse as a Backend

This portal template uses Synapse as its backend. Synapse can handle and store all the data you want to display in your portal, including files, datasets, tables, and more. The portal retrieves this data dynamically from Synapse, meaning any updates made to the relevant data in your Synapse project will be reflected in the portal as well. Synapse also allows you to manage the accessibility of your data through permissions, ensuring that the right people can view and contribute to your project.

The data used in this portal template can be found in this Synapse Project: https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn60582629/wiki/.

### Create Your Own Synapse Project

1. First, register for a Synapse account at https://www.synapse.org to get basic functionality access.

2. Create a new project by clicking "Projects" > "Create a New Project".
