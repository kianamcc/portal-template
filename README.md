# Synapse Portal Template

## What is the Synapse Portal Template?

This template provides a foundation for building your own Synapse-integrated portal. It streamlines the process, enabling you to create a portal tailored to your community’s needs while utilizing Synapse's powerful infrastructure. Visit https://www.synapse.org to learn more about Synapse.

## Viewing the Synapse Portal Template

To see the template website, go to: https://synapse-portal-template.vercel.app. You must be signed in to your Synapse account to view certain components of the website due to some data currently not being open access. To learn more about access types, [go to the Open Access section](#open-access).

## Getting Started

This is a template repository so you can easily create a new repository based on this template repository.

1. Click on the "Use this template" dropdown on the repository page and select "Create a new repository". This will create a new repository in your GitHub account based on this template.

2. Once your new repository is created, clone it to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
   cd YOUR_REPOSITORY
   ```

3. To run, in the root of the project, use the following commands:

## Using Synapse as a Backend

This portal template uses Synapse as its backend. Synapse can handle and store all the data you want to display in your portal, including files, datasets, tables, and more. The portal retrieves this data dynamically from Synapse, meaning any updates made to the relevant data in your Synapse project will be reflected in the portal as well. Synapse also allows you to manage the accessibility of your data through permissions, ensuring that the right people can view and contribute to your project.

The data used in this portal template can be found in this Synapse project: https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn60582629/wiki/.

### Create Your Own Synapse Project

1. First, register for a Synapse account at https://www.synapse.org to get basic functionality access.

2. Create a new project by clicking "Projects" > "Create a New Project".

3. You can copy tables, links, files, folders, and projects used in this portal into your new project using the copy function. Below is an example using the Synapse Python Client.

```
import synapseclient
import synapseutils

syn = synapseclient.login(authToken=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN)

synapseutils.copy(syn, "syn60582629", SYN_ID_OF_DESTINATION)
```

Refer to the docs for more details about this copy function: https://python-docs.synapse.org/reference/synapse_utils/#synapseutils.copy_functions.copy.

## Using Synapse as an OAuth Server

To quickly setup login functionality for your portal, you can use Synapse as your OAuth Server.

By using Synapse as the OAuth provider, we can simplify the authentication process for third party applications and allow them to securely access user data in Synapse. The app redirects users to https://signin.synapse.org and Synapse will handle the login process. Synapse will then return back with an authorization code, which can be used to obtain an access token to make authenticated requests.

To create a new OAuth client with Synapse, you can do so directly from the Synapse website or the Python and R clients.

### Make a Synapse OAuth Client in synapse.org
1. First, login to [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org).

2. Click on your user icon then navigate to "Account Settings" > "OAuth Clients" > "Manage OAuth Clients" then click the "Create New Client" button. This will open up a popup form. Fill in the popup form and click save.

3. Take note of your client ID and secret.

4. You must have your OAuth Client verified in order to use it. Click on the "Submit Verification" button for your newly created OAuth Client under the "Verified Column" and follow the instructions.

5. Once verified, update the value for VITE_PORTAL_SECRET and VITE_PORTAL_CLIENT in the .env file with your OAuth secret ID and client ID. Environment variables can also be configured in your deployment platform of choice.

### Redirect URIs

When using multiple hosts (ex: production and dev) as redirect URIs, a sector_identifier_uri parameter (https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html#SectorIdentifierValidation ) is required.

Update the redirect_uris.json file in the public folder of the project with your production environment/any other environment you want. Redirect uri http://127.0.0.1:3000 in the json file is for the development environment.

Make sure to fill out the Sector Identifier URI section on the OAuth Client form with the URL of where the redirect_uris.json is hosted (your-hosted-website.someHost/redirect-uris.json. Ex: https://synapse-portal-template.vercel.app/redirect_uris.json.

### Make a Synapse OAuth Client with the Python Client

You can create an OAuth client using the Python Client as shown below:

```
# client.py

import synapseclient
import json
syn = synapseclient.login()

client_meta_data = {
  'client_name': 'gf-portal',
  # Refer to section below for setting up redirect_uris
  'redirect_uris': [
    'https://gray-portal.vercel.app',
    'http://127.0.0.1:3000',
  ],
  'sector_identifier_uri': "https://gray-portal.vercel.app/redirect_uris.json"
}

# Create the client:
client_meta_data = syn.restPOST(uri='/oauth2/client', 
	endpoint=syn.authEndpoint, body=json.dumps(client_meta_data))

client_id = client_meta_data['client_id']

# Generate and retrieve the client secret:
client_id_and_secret = syn.restPOST(uri='/oauth2/client/secret/'+client_id, 
	endpoint=syn.authEndpoint, body='')

print(client_id_and_secret)
```

For more information about using Synapse as an OAuth Server, please refer to: https://help.synapse.org/docs/Using-Synapse-as-an-OAuth-Server.2048327904.html

## Open Access

When signed out of the portal template website, users can view datasets and files but not publications. To view publications, you must be signed in. This is because file contents and table row data are not viewable or downloadable anonymously unless they are marked as OPEN_DATA.

Please refer to https://help.synapse.org/docs/Data-Access-Types.2014904611.html for more information about the different data access types in Synapse.

## CI/CD

Continuous Integration and Continuous Development (CI/CD) is implemented for this portal using GitHub Actions and Vercel.

Actions:
- action.yml
  - Responsible for installing the correct version of Node.js, configuring Pnpm and caching dependencies.

Workflows:
- end-to-end-test-portals.yml
  - Retrieves latest codebase, uses the Pnpm setup action to make sure dependencies are installed, builds the portal project, installs and sets up Playwright Browsers for testing, runs end-to-end tests, and uploads test results as artifacts.

## Testing

This portal uses End-to-End (E2E) testing with Playwright.

### Testing Locally

1. Run the local server before starting tests. In the root directory, you can run the project using the command pnpm dev.

2. In the portals-e2e directory, use the pnpm e2e command to run the tests.

## Deployment

This portal template is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) at https://synapse-portal-template.vercel.app. Vercel is a fast and reliable platform that allows you to deploy frontend applications, offering integration with GitHub for automatic deployments. Whenever changes are pushed to the repository, Vercel automatically builds and deploys the site, providing preview URLs for testing.

When deploying your project to Vercel, make sure the root directory is apps/portal, the directory of the code we want to deploy.

## Vercel OAuth Configuration: Handling Unique Preview URLs for Redirects

Vercel creates unique URLs for each preview which results in not being able to use OAuth for the previews as the URLs are not registered with the Synapse OAuth Client. To solve this issue, we use GitHub Actions. A branch named latest-preview was created specifically for managing preview deployments that require OAuth. This branch is automatically updated using GitHub Actions to mirror ([zofrex/mirror-branch](zofrex/mirror-branch)) the latest commit from any branch with this commit message: [latest-preview]. The Vercel CLI was used to assign a stable alias, _template-latest-preview.app.vercel_, to the latest-preview branch. In your GitHub repository, go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions, and update your VERCEL_ORG_ID, VERCEL_PROJECT_ID, and VERCEL_TOKEN. The organization ID and project ID can be found in .vercel > project.json file in your project.
